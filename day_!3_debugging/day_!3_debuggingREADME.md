# Day 13 - Debugging in Python 🐞🔧

On **Day 13** of the 100 Days of Python challenge, I focused on **debugging techniques**, understanding how to identify and resolve common programming errors in Python.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Types of bugs:
  - Syntax errors
  - Logical errors
  - Runtime errors

- Debugging tools and techniques:
  - Using `print()` statements to trace values
  - Understanding error messages and tracebacks
  - Reading and interpreting stack traces
  - Using Python Tutor or built-in debuggers
  - Stepping through code with IDE debuggers

- Common mistakes:
  - Off-by-one errors in loops
  - Misplaced indentation
  - Overwritten variables
  - Infinite loops

---

## 💡 Takeaways

- **Read the error messages carefully** — they often tell you exactly what's wrong.
- **Step-by-step execution** of code helps to isolate bugs.
- **Clean, readable code** makes debugging easier.
- **Consistent testing** during development helps catch bugs early.

## 📌 Note

This day focused on **theory and analysis**, so no specific `.py` script was produced. The main goal was to improve error resolution skills and become more confident in debugging Python code.
