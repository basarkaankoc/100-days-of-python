# Day 02 - Tip Calculator ðŸ’°

This is a simple **Tip Calculator** built with Python as part of my [100 Days of Python](https://github.com/basarkaankoc/100-days-of-python) journey.

The program:
- Takes the total bill amount
- Asks the user how much tip (as %) they'd like to give (e.g., 10, 12, 15)
- Asks how many people are splitting the bill
- Calculates and displays how much each person should pay ðŸ’¸

---

## ðŸ§® Example

What was the total bill? $150
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 15
