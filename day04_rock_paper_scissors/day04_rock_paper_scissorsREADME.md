# Day 04 - Rock Paper Scissors ✊📄✂️

This is a Python implementation of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game as part of my [100 Days of Python](https://github.com/basarkaankoc/100-days-of-python) challenge.

The game allows the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer then makes a random choice, and the winner is determined by classic rules.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

Run the script and enter:
- `0` for Rock
- `1` for Paper
- `2` for Scissors

The computer will also make a random choice, and the game will display who wins.

## 💡 Sample Run

```
What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors.

## 📚 Concepts Used

- `input()` for user interaction
- `random.randint()` to generate computer choice
- Multiline strings for ASCII graphics
- List indexing
- Conditional logic with `if-elif-else`
