# Day 07 - Hangman Game ðŸŽ¯

This is a Python implementation of the classic **Hangman** game as part of my [100 Days of Python](https://github.com/basarkaankoc/100-days-of-python) challenge.

---

## ðŸŽ® Game Overview

- A random word is selected from a predefined list.
- The player has 6 lives and must guess the word letter by letter.
- Incorrect guesses reduce lives and show hangman stages.
- Repeated guesses are handled with feedback.
- The game ends when the word is guessed or all lives are lost.

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced

- Modular code with external Python files (`hangman_words`, `hangman_art`)
- Lists and strings
- For loops
- Conditionals and input validation
- Game loop with `while not game_over`
- ASCII art rendering
