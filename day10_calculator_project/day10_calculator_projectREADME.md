# Day 10 - Calculator Project üßÆ

A terminal-based calculator built in Python as part of my [100 Days of Python](https://github.com/basarkaankoc/100-days-of-python) journey.

It supports:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

You can chain operations using the result of the previous calculation, start a new calculation, or exit anytime.

## üß† Concepts Practiced

- Functions and return values
- Dictionaries with functions as values
- Loops and recursion
- User input and type casting (`float`)
- Input validation and conditional branching

What's the first number?: 10  
Pick an operation: +  
What's the next number?: 5  
10 + 5 = 15.0

Type 'y' to continue calculating with the result, 'n' to start a new calculation, or 'c' to exit: y  
Pick an operation: *  
What's the next number?: 2  
15.0 * 2 = 30.0

Type 'y' to continue calculating with the result, 'n' to start a new calculation, or 'c' to exit: c  
Calculator exited. Goodbye!
```

## ‚úÖ Features

- Chained operations using previous result  
- Clean restart option (`n`)  
- Exit command (`c`) without closing terminalS
- Simple and readable code structure
- ASCII art interface for aesthetics

## üìå Notes

- You can add more operations by expanding the `operations` dictionary.
- To clear screen properly, consider using `os.system('cls')` on Windows or `clear` on Unix-based systems.
- Recursion is used to restart the calculator ‚Äî which works fine here but be cautious of stack overflow in bigger apps.
