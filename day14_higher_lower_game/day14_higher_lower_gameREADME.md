# Day 14 - Higher or Lower Game 🎯📊

This is a Python implementation of the **Higher or Lower** game, developed as part of my [100 Days of Python](https://github.com/basarkaankoc/100-days-of-python) challenge.

The player is presented with two popular public figures and must guess who has more followers on social media. Each correct guess increases the score, and the game continues until the user makes a wrong guess.

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Two accounts are compared: **A** and **B**.
- You will be shown a description for each.
- Type `'a'` or `'b'` to guess who has **more followers**.
- The game ends when you guess wrong.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Dictionaries and data structures
- Random selection with `random.choice()`
- Functions and logic control
- Importing from other Python files
- String formatting and ASCII art
