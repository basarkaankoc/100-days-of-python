# 100 Days of Python üêç

This repository documents my 100-day Python learning journey, featuring small projects and exercises completed daily.  
The learning process is supported by the excellent Udemy course **"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"** by **Dr. Angela Yu**.

Each folder contains the code and files related to that day's project or exercise.
